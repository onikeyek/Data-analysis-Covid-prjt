#COVID PROJECT (SQL)

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to understand the pandemic's impact on cases, deaths, and vaccinations using the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` datasets. The objectives include:

1. **Basic Data Retrieval**: Extract and sort data from the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables.
2. **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths**: Calculate the likelihood of dying from COVID-19, focusing on specific countries.
3. **Total Cases vs. Population**: Derive infection rates and identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
4. **Highest Death Counts**: Determine countries with the highest death counts per population and break down by continent.
5. **Global Numbers**: Summarize global new cases, deaths, and calculate death percentages over time.
6. **Vaccination Analysis**: Compare population against vaccination data and analyze the relationship between deaths and vaccinations.
7. **Advanced Analysis**: Use CTEs and temporary tables for complex calculations and create a view to summarize vaccination percentages relative to the population.

By leveraging SQL's advanced querying capabilities, the project offers a robust framework for understanding the pandemic's impact across different regions.
